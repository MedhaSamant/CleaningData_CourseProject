This is code book for the mean data from from the accelerometer and gyroscope 3-axial for 30 people over 6 different activities.

Feature Summary
==================

- The original features selected for this database come from the accelerometer and gyroscope 3-axial raw signals tAcc-XYZ and tGyro-XYZ for 30 people (Subjects). 

- Each subject was measured for six different activities 
- The features were then filtered to get only the mean and standard deviation for each measurement.

- Finally those mean and std deviations were then averaged for each subject for each activity. 


Details
===============

Here are the details about all the data elements
- subject :: person for whom the data was collected (1 through 30)
- activity :: activity the person was doing at the time of data collection (LAYING, SITTING, STANDING, WALKING, WALKING_DOWNSTAIRS, WALKING_STANDING)
